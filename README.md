# Hello CPM Demonstration

This is a toy application created to test and demonstrate using [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) for dependency managment and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for build.

## Prerequisites for testing

You will need the XMOS toolchain installed and your environment setup.  Only Tools 15 has been tested, however, Tools 14 should also work.  

CMake version 3.14 or newer is required.  Download newer versions from [CMake downloads](https://cmake.org/download/).

## Instructions for testing

Create a directory for your sandbox:

    $ mkdir my_sandbox

Switch to the sandbox directory:

    $ cd my_sandbox

Clone the repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:keithm-xmos/sw_hellocpm.git

To build the application, see the README.md in the `app_hellocpm` folder.
